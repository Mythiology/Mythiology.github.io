### Forensics
## Mr Robot
Challenge description:

Mr. Robot most famous TV show but least people know about it.
Flag Format: CYBERGRABS{}
[audio file](/Cybergrabs/chall.wav)

Writeup:
Initially I tried to a lot of forensics method on it including sstv, extracting files from it, stegnography and extracting lsb.
After about 5 hours of trying, I checked with the admin and realised that I missed the flag. So after going through all of the process again, extracting lsb using [lsb stego](https://github.com/ragibson/Steganography) actually gives us a flag... Wasted my time on this ;-;

Theres really nothing on the website, so I went to check for cookies which returns a value

Cookie : Y3liZXJncmFic3tpdHNfZWFzeV93ZWJ9
Now going onto [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) , we can find out that Y3liZXJncmFic3tpdHNfZWFzeV93ZWJ9 is in base 64

Used IDA PRO 64 to disassemble to file and found this line of code.
{% highlight c %}
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  char v4[32]; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-90h] BYREF
  char s[104]; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-70h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v6; // [rsp+98h] [rbp-8h]

  v6 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  qmemcpy(v4, "h3r3_w3_g0_4g4in!", 17);
  puts("Serving for a second.... cause that's what I do!!");
  sprintf(s, "echo %s | nc 0.0.0.0 %d", v4, 9999LL);
